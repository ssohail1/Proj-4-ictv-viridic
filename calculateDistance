#intergenomic distance calculation
# idAB = identical bases when genome A is aligned to genome B
# idBA = identical bases when genome B is aligned to genome A 
# lA = length genome A 
# lB = length genome B
# simAB = intergenomic similarity between genomes A and B
# distAB =  intergenomic distance between genomes A and B


#simAB = ((idAB + idBA) * 100)/(lA + lB)
# distAB = 100 - simAB
# in order to calcualte intergenomic distance we need the following from our blast output:
# output need: 


CODE:

# first we want to read the sampleblastoutA.txt file 
# then read the sampleblastoutB.txt file
